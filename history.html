        <h3>History of Horlanif Enterprise</h3>
        <p>
            Horlanif Enterprise was founded in 2016 by Muftau Saheed Olamiposi, prior to his admission into the
            university. The business began with the importation and sale of memory cards, flash drives, and ear pods,
            serving customers in Osogbo, Osun State.

            Upon gaining admission into the university, the business expanded to Ikole and Oye Ekiti, where additional
            services such as online registration, school fee payments, and academic support were introduced. These
            services helped strengthen the brand’s presence within the student community and increased its customer
            base.

            During his NYSC year in Ibadan, Horlanif Enterprise experienced further growth, extending its reach across
            Oyo State and attracting a wider customer base.

            Over the years, the brand diversified its product and service offerings beyond gadgets to include: <br>
            o Phones and Power Banks <br>

            o Phone Holders and USB Bulbs <br>

            o Electronic Gadgets <br>

            o Kitchen Appliances <br>

            o Quality Customized Jerseys (Football & Basketball). <br>
            In addition to physical products, Horlanif Enterprise also provides professional services such as pre-order
            training, thesis and project writing, online registration, graphic design, and web design. As a Frontend Web
            Developer, Muftau Saheed Olamiposi now leads the company’s digital services, designing and building modern,
            responsive, and user-friendly websites for individuals, students, and businesses.

            The brand name Horlanif was formed from the founder’s names "Olamiposi and Nifemi" representing a blend of
            personal identity, passion, and vision.

            As a graduate of Agricultural Engineering with a strong interest in smart farming and irrigation systems,
            Muftau Saheed Olamiposi envisions expanding Horlanif Enterprise into the agricultural sector, integrating
            modern technology into farming to promote food security and sustainable agriculture in Nigeria.

            Today, Horlanif Enterprise has grown from a small gadget business into a multi-service enterprise with
            operations across the South-West region of Nigeria and a customer base spread nationwide. Guided by
            innovation, trust, and customer satisfaction, the company continues to pursue its vision of becoming one of
            Nigeria’s most reliable and diversified brands.
