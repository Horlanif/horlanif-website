        <h3>History of Horlanif Enterprise</h3>
        <p> <b>Horlanif Enterprise</b> was founded in 2016 by Muftau Saheed Olamiposi, prior to his admission into the
            university. The business started with the importation and sales of memory cards, flash drives, and ear pods,
            serving customers in Osogbo, Osun State.
            Upon admission into the university, the business expanded to Ikole and Oye Ekiti, where he added online
            registration services, assisting students with school payments and academic registrations. This strengthened
            the business presence within the student community.
            During his NYSC year in Ibadan, Horlanif Enterprise reached a wider audience, extending its customer base
            across Oyo State. <br> Over the years, the brand diversified its offerings, moving beyond gadgets to: <br>
            Phones and Power Banks <br>
            Phone Holders and USB Bulbs <br>
            Electronic Gadgets
            Kitchen Appliances <br>
            Quality Customized Jerseys (Football & Basketball) <br>
            In addition, the company offers professional services such as pre-order training, thesis/project writing,
            online registration, graphic design, and web design.
            The brand name Horlanif was creatively formed from two names: Olamiposi and Nifemi (the founder’s names),
            symbolizing a blend of personal identity and vision. <br>
            As a graduate of Agricultural Engineering, with a keen interest in smart farming and irrigation systems,
            Muftau Saheed Olamiposi also envisions expanding Horlanif Enterprise into the agriculture sector. His goal
            is to Integrate modern technology with farming practices, contributing to food security and sustainable
            agriculture in Nigeria.

            Today, Horlanif Enterprise has grown from a small gadget business into a multi-service enterprise with
            operations covering the entire South-West region of Nigeria, and a customer base spread across the entire
            country. Guided by innovation, trust, and customer satisfaction, the company continues to pursue its vision
            of being one of Nigeria’s most reliable and diversified brands.
